# Bill Split API

# Overview
This is a simple implentation of a Bill Splitting API which receives json information about the amount individuals pay for, and how to reconcile the inherit "unfairness" of certain expenses costing more. In other words, it produces a list of transaction information to easily show how much one individual needs to pay another individual in order to make sure all contributors payed roughly the same amount for shared expenses.
